    Example: `public/novels/My-Awesome-Novel/Volume 1.pdf`
3.  Add a cover image (e.g., `cover.jpg`, `cover.png`) to the novel's folder. The file name should contain "cover".
    Example: `public/novels/My-Awesome-Novel/cover.jpg`
4.  Create a `synopsis.json` file inside the novel's folder with the following format:
    ```json

    }
    ```
