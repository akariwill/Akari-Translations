    "synopsis": "Maki Maehara is always on his own at school. He has no friends or hobbies others share, and he doesn't expect the upcoming academic year to be any different, even surrounded by new faces. And six months later, it seems like he was rightâ€”until he runs into his popular classmate Umi Asanagi at a video store! Always at the center of attention and called the second prettiest in class by the boys, Asanagi's from a totally different world. But it turns out the two have more overlapping interests than just the B-grade movies they came to check out...and Asanagi asks Maehara to be her friend! (Source: Yen Press)"
